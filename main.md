## 1. Overview
This markdown file will include the main contents of this workshop. Here, we will discuss any important information and describe some of the main aspects of the molecular dynamics (MD) workflow demonstrated in this repository. The main sections of `main.md` are listed above in the Contents section.

## 2. Preparation 
First, we will install the necessary software for executing our MD workflow. The following list is intended as a guide to get started. It may not be comprehensive for all purposes. Please refer to each software's webpage for details/requirements of installation. We will use [PACKMOL](http://leandro.iqm.unicamp.br/m3g/packmol/examples.shtml), [Moltemplate](https://www.moltemplate.org/), and [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/).

For the time being, I will assume that you are using a Linux machine (or WSL in Windows10) and that you are familiar with terminal commands. In the future, I may incorporate more detailed instructions on setting up your machine for running this workflow.

### A. This repository
First, clone this repository locally where you usually keep repos (e.g., `~/repos/`). You can `cd` into the desired directory and then run the following command.
```
git clone git@github.com:DReGuerra/molecular_dynamics_workshop.git
```

### B. Auxilliary
1. Install miniconda package manager
    Download the executable installer for Linux x86_64.
    ```
    curl -sL \
    "https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh" > \
    "Miniconda3.sh"
    ```
    Run installer.
    ```
    bash Miniconda3.sh
    ```
2. Install git version control
    ```
    sudo apt install git
    ```
### C. LAMMPS
More details on LAMMPS can be found [here](https://www.lammps.org/).
1. Create a conda environment of LAMMPS 
    ```
    conda create -n lammps
    ```
2. Install LAMMPS
    Activate the conda environment
    ```
    conda activate lammps
    ```
    Install LAMMPS
    ```
    conda install lammps -c conda-forge
    ```
*NOTE:* From this point on, you need to activate the `lammps` conda environment before running LAMMPS.

3. Clone the LAMMPS git repository in a directory called lammps in home (i.e., `~/lammps`)
    ```
    git clone -b stable https://github.com/lammps/lammps.git ~/lammps
    ```
4. Test LAMMPS
    This will run the example script VISCOSITY provided in the LAMMPS repository. It will take a minute or two to completely run.
    ```
    cd ~/lammps/examples/VISCOSITY/ && lmp_serial -in in.wall.2d
    ```
If the example simulation ran correctly, at this point LAMMPS is fully installed. 

### D. Moltemplate
More details on Moltemplate can be found [here](https://www.moltemplate.org/).
1. Clone the Moltemplate git repository in a directory called moltemplate in home (i.e., `~/moltemplate`)
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jewettaij/moltemplate ~/moltemplate
    ```
2. Update your system
    ```
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
    ```
3. Build moltemplate
    ```
    cd ~/moltemplate && pip install . --user
    ```
4. Export `.local/bin` to PATH

    cd ~/packmol/examples/ && packmol < bilayer.inp
    ```
If the script ran without problems, at this point PACKMOL is fully installed.

## 3. Workflow
The molecular dynamics simulation presented here makes use of the `run.sh` script to control the workflow and execute the stages necessary to complete the simulation. 

### A. Script parameters
The `run.sh` bash script has input parameters which are handled in the "0. Prep" section of the script by the `while getops` block. Below we have this block from the script.
```
#  0. Prep
# handle flag(s)
while getopts g:w:d:e:s:r:n:f:p: flag
do
    case "${flag}" in
        g) gas=${OPTARG};;
        w) water=${OPTARG};;
        d) seed=${OPTARG};;
        e) ensemble=${OPTARG};;
        s) steps=${OPTARG};;
        r) restart=${OPTARG};;
        n) restartFreq=${OPTARG};;
        f) restartFile=${OPTARG};;
        p) rep=${OPTARG};;
    esac
done
```
We now list the inputs, flags, description, and expected values for all inputs to the `run.sh`.

| Input        |Flag | Expected values         | Description                                |
|--------------|-----|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| gas          | -g  | [water, ch4, co2]       | is there ch4 or co2 gas in the system?     |
| water        | -w  | [tip4pice, tip4p2005]   | water potential used                       |
| seed         | -d  | [123456, etc.]          | random number generator seed               |
| ensemble     | -e  | [npt, nvt, nve]         | ensemble fix                               |
| steps        | -s  | [1000000, etc.]         | timesteps to run simulation                |
| restart      | -r  | [false, restart]        | is this a restart simulation?              |
| restartFreq  | -n  | [250000, etc.]          | freq to output restart file in timesteps   |
| restartFile  | -f  | ["./dir/FileName.data"] | name of restart file                       |
| rep          | -p  | [false, true]           | is this a replicate simulation?            |

*NOTE:* for our purposes, the following inputs will be always set to their default values.
| Input        |Flag | Default for our purposes      |
|--------------|-----|-------------------------------|
| gas          | -g  | [water]                       |
| water        | -w  | [tip4pice]                    |
| seed         | -d  | [123456]                      |
| ensemble     | -e  | [npt]                         |
| steps        | -s  | [20000]                       |
| restart      | -r  | [false]                       |
| restartFreq  | -n  | [2500]                        |
| restartFile  | -f  | ["./restart/restartEnd.data"] |
| rep          | -p  | [false]                       |

This means that the script call to execute our workflow using `run.sh` looks like:
```
./run.sh -g water -w tip4pice -d 123456 -e npt -s 20000 -r false -n 2500 -f "./restart/restartEnd.data" -p false
```
If this does not run, make sure your `run.sh` is executable with:
```
chmod +x run.sh
```
*NOTE:* Remember to `cd` into the main directory of this repository before running the `run.sh` script.

### B. PACKMOL
The first execution in our workflow is PACKMOL in section "1. PACKMOL" of the `run.sh` script. 

Objective: The goal of PACKMOL is to randomly populate the simbox of our system with the molecules we want and each of them within a tolerance distance from each other. This helps to minimize the repulsive forces between molecules that can arise when using a lattice command to populate the simbox with a regular pattern space between molecules.

In this section of the code, the script verifies if this is a restarted simulation or not using the variable `restart` which was initiated from our input flag `-r`. Since our simulation is not a restart (`$restart = 'false'`), flow moves into the `if` statement block and executes PACKMOL. Notice that we `cd` in and out of the PACKMOL directory to make sure we can access the input files and that the outputs are contained in the right directory.
```
# 1. Execute PACKMOL
echo -------------------------------------------------
echo ">>>PACKMOL: $(date)<<<"
echo ">>>"
if [ $restart = 'false' ]
then
    # cd into packmol dir
    cd 1_packmol/
    # run packmol
    packmol < in_2pack_H2O.inp
    # return to original project directory
    cd ../
fi
```

### C. Moltemplate
The second step in our workflow is to execute Moltemplate.

Objective: The goal of Moltemplate is to assign the force field potential parameters to each molecules in our system.

The first thing to do is to activate our lammps conda environment (which will also be necessary for the next step running LAMMPS). Next, the script once again checks if this is a restarted simulation (see previous section explanation). Since it is not, flow moves into the `if` statement and Moltemplate is executed. Notice that we `cd` into the directory `input_files` before executing Moltemplate. This is where we have most the required input files.

A couple of peculiarities in this block:
1. we need to rename our `system_H2O.lt` file to `system.lt`. This is so that we can properly run the script `cleanup_moltemplate.sh` after running Moltemplate to clean auxilliary files produced. This script expects the output files to be named on a basis of `system.lt`.
2. We use the output from PACKMOL by refering to it using relative reference `../../1_packmol/out_packed.xyz`
3. We move the output files up one directory level to separate them from the input files
```
# source lammps env
conda activate lammps

# 2. Execute MOLTEMPLATE
echo -------------------------------------------------
echo ">>>MOLTEMPLATE: $(date)<<<"
echo ">>>"
if [ $restart = 'false' ]
then
    # go into 2_moltemplate/input_files/
    cd 2_moltemplate/input_files
    # define system identify
    cp system_H2O.lt system.lt
    # run moltemplate giving system.lt as input and the data file generated by packmol
    moltemplate.sh -xyz ../../1_packmol/out_packed.xyz system.lt
    # delete input lammps script produced
    rm system.in
    # remove extra information in settings and data files
    cleanup_moltemplate.sh
    # copy the output files to the lammps directory for execution
    cp system.data ../../3_lammps
    # cp system.data system.in* ../../3_lammps/equil
    # move the output files up to the parent directory
    mv -f system.data system.in* ../
    # delete the temporary files produced by moltemplate
    # these are good for debugging, comment if debugging is necessary
    rm -rf output_ttree/
    # return to original project directory
    cd ../../
fi
```

### D. LAMMPS
In the final step of our workflow we execute the actual molecular dynamics simulation using LAMMPS.

Objective: In this step, we conduct the molecular dynamics algorithm and produce molecular trajectory file (and possibly other output files as desired).

In this block, we execute LAMMPS with `lmp_serial` (you may change this to your needs). We feed the LAMMPS input script using the flag `-in`, and we specify the name of the output log file with the flag `-log`. Additionally, we feed the input parameters to our `run.sh` script as parameters (see previous sections) into our LAMMPS input script. Finally, our simulation will output various restart files (at every `$restartFreq` timesteps) and one final restart file at the end of the simulation, which is named different than the periodic ones. So, at the end of this block, we delete all the intermediate restart files, IFF the final restart file was produced. This is to save space. If the simulation was trunkated, and no final restart file was produce, then the intermediate files are kept.
```
# 3. Execute LAMMPS
echo -------------------------------------------------
echo ">>>LAMMPS: $(date)<<<"
echo ">>>"

cd 3_lammps/
# run 
lmp_serial -in run.ag.in -log log.$ensemble.lammps \
-v gas $gas \
-v wat $water \
-v seed $seed \
-v restart_sim $restart \
-v restart_freq $restartFreq \
-v ensemble $ensemble \
-v restartFile $restartFile \
-v steps $steps \
-v replicate $rep
# remove extra restarts if the restartEnd exists
if [ -f restart/restartEnd_${ensemble}_${steps}step.data ]
then
    rm restart/restart_$ensemble*
fi
# back up to test dir
cd ../
```
